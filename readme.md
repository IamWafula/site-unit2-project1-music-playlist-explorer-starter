### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

` 
  The topics discussed on class provided a solid foundation for exploring the requirements for the assignment. Overviews of Javascript functionality and CSS styling helped me knnow exactly what to look up when I experience blockers.
`

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

`
  Beginning with a solid design would have sped up development. This project was created procedurally which slowed me down when I had issued with styling. 
  I would add consistent data within the website, using some back-end service. I would also ass user authentication to protect the stored data.
`
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

`
  As a first project, I did not expect the exact due date. If we were informed to focus on the project more than the labs initially, I would have refined the final presentation more. 
  I also did not know what external libraries we could use, a lot of development time was spent on manually styling elements rather than developing features.
  Going forward, I would focus more on features and finish with styling as an afterthought. 
  I saw a peer use Github authentication, which I will try in my next project.
